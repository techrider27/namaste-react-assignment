# What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is basically a JavaScript syntax which makes creation of React Elements easily, rather than creating with "React.createElement". It is HTML or XML like syntax.

# Superpowers of JSX?
1. It takes care of injection attacks.
2. It takes care of XSS attacks.
3. It lets developers to create elements in efficient manner as per compared to the core React which uses creatElement.

# Role of "type" attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
The "type" indicates what type of script it is. We can use options and they are as follows:
1. module - This "module" we used with parcel to support classic scripts, which do not support synchronous imports or export.
2. importmap
3. application/ecmascript
4. application/javascript

# `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` in JSX?

`{TitleComponent}` - To put react element inside a component or write a JavaScript we use curly braces.
<br>
E.g - `const heading = <h2>This is react element</h2>
            <br>
                const HeadingComponent =()=>(
                <>
                {heading}
                </>
            );`

- `{<TitleComponent/>}` - Using `<Component/>` we perform component composition. We write components inside this `{< />}`.

`{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` - Both `{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` & `{<TitleComponent/>}` are same in terms of working 
and usage it totally depends on the developer whether the developer wants to use the first one or second one for the calling the functional
components. 

`{<Component></Component}`,`{<Component/>}`,`{Component()}` are all same.
