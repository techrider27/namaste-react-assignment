# Is JSX mandatory for React?
No, JSX is not mandatory for React, we can also use core react. But to make our code clear, readable & most importantly ease the developer's work, JSX is used.

E.g - Core React
const heading = React.createElement("h1",{className:"heading"},"Hello Gaurav Sangewar");

E.g - Same using JSX

const heading = <h1>This is also a valid react element.</h1>

# Is ES6 mandatory for React?
No, ES6 is not mandatory for React, we can use alternatives but according to industry trends we use some concepts that are used in react and make our code clean, readable & easy to maintain such as let, const, arrow functions, promise, etc. Thus we use ES6 concepts in React.

# `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` in JSX?

{TitleComponent} - To put react element inside a component or write a JavaScript we use curly braces.
E.g - const heading = `<h2>This is react element</h2>`

            const HeadingComponent =()=>(
                <>
                {heading}
                </>
            );

`{<TitleComponent/>}` - Using `<Component/>` we perform component composition. We write components inside this {< />}.

`{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` - Both `{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>}` & `{<TitleComponent/>}` are same in terms of working 
and usage it totally depends on the developer whether the developer wants to use the first one or second one for the calling the functional
components. 

`{<Component></Component}`,`{<Component/>}`,{Component()} are all same.

# How can I write comments in JSX?
We can use `{/* */}` in JSX, which is applicable for single and multiline comments.

# What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and <></>?
`<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` are the same thing, they are used to return multiple elements. It acts a parent element in JSX.

# What is Virtual DOM?
Virtual DOM is basically a representation of an actual DOM, which is an object that contains react elements. And this helps React to provide faster DOM manipulation.

# What is Reconciliation in React?
Reaconciliation is process through which React updates the DOM. It was introduced in React 16. In simple words it as new way of finding the difference between the Virtual DOM & the current DOM.

# What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is nothing but the new reconciler algorithm in React which finds the difference between the Virual DOM and current DOM.

# Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
We need keys because the React does not uniquely identify a particular element when we loop over something. And due to this react re-renders all the components which is not good for large applications & also considered as bad practice. We need keys when we want to give the elements a stable unique identity.

# Can we use index as keys in React?
We can use index as keys in React only if it is the last option when we don't have any id's that will uniquely identify elements. The best and preferable method is to use unique id's in React such as unique id from backend, manualy giving id's.

# What is props in React? Ways to 
Props are the information that we can pass to any component or JSX element in React. In simple words props are called properties which we pass to component and they are just normal arguments to a function.

E.g - For JSX element `<img src="dummy.png" alt="Image" width={100} height={100}>`
      For component `<Component person={{name:'Gaurav Sangewar', professtion:'React Developer'}}/>`

# What is a Config Driven UI?
A website or web app driven by data is known as config driven UI. In config driven UI data controls the UI of webapp which comes from backend.
